# SDDL Validation using SMB Protocol
This small POC helps you to establish a client-server connection using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. 
You will be able to do the following:
1. Create and manage connections from remote computers to a server in your network using SMB protocol
2. Fetch Their security descriptors in a readable format (see SecurityDescriptor.getString())
3. Validate the security descriptors you received through SMBBuffers
